# pdf-to-cbz
Python script which converts PDF files to CBZ format for PerfectViewer or other comic reader.

Just change the read_dir and write_dir variables at the top of the script and run from terminal.

Tested in Linux and Windows.

I've got a lot of books and papers in PDF format and I find them easier to read in comic readers.
